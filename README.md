With Laravel N8N, you can integrate various services, trigger workflows, and manage your automation tasks efficiently.

## Installation

To install Laravel N8N, you can use Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require yoanhuke/laravel-n8n
```

Once installed, publish the configuration file using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Yoanhuke\LaravelN8N\LaravelN8NServiceProvider"
```

You can now configure your n8n API credentials in the `config/laravel-n8n.php` file.

## Usage

### Configuration

Before using Laravel N8N, make sure to set your n8n API credentials in the configuration file. Open `config/laravel-n8n.php` and add your API key and endpoint.

```php
return [
    'api_key' => env('N8N_API_KEY'),
    'api_url' => env('N8N_API_URL', 'https://your-n8n-instance.com'),
];
```

### Basic Example

Here’s a simple example of how to trigger a workflow:

```php
use Yoanhuke\LaravelN8N\Facades\N8N;

$response = N8N::trigger('your-workflow-id', [
    'data' => [
        'key' => 'value',
    ],
]);

if ($response->successful()) {
    echo "Workflow triggered successfully!";
} else {
    echo "Failed to trigger workflow.";
}
```

### Webhook Example

To handle webhooks, you can define a route in your `routes/web.php` file:

```php
Route::post('/webhook/n8n', function () {
    $data = request()->all();
    
    // Process the incoming data
    // ...

    return response()->json(['status' => 'success']);
});
```

Then, configure your n8n workflow to call this webhook URL whenever the event occurs.

## API Documentation

The Laravel N8N package provides a set of methods to interact with the n8n API. Below are some key methods:

### Trigger Workflow

N8N::trigger($workflowId, $data);
```

- **$data**: An array of data to send to the workflow.

### Get Workflow

```php
N8N::getWorkflow($workflowId);
```

- **$workflowId**: The ID of the workflow to retrieve.

### List Workflows

## Examples

### Automating Email Notifications

You can use Laravel N8N to automate email notifications. Here’s how:

1. Create a workflow in n8n that sends an email.
2. Trigger this workflow from your Laravel application when a user registers.

```php
N8N::trigger('email-notification-workflow', [
    'email' => $user->email,
]);
```

### Data Sync Between Services

If you need to sync data between two services, you can set up a workflow in n8n that handles this. Trigger it from Laravel when necessary.

```php
N8N::trigger('data-sync-workflow', [
    'data' => $dataToSync,
]);
```
